    date: "2022-07", blurb: "4th of July on the water in Pittsburgh. It was our first time kayaking out to 'The Point' where they launch off the fireworks. Paddling back in the dark battling the chop from all the boats made it extra 'Brian fun,' less 'Alyssa fun.'", images: [

It was Brian's last conference trip for his PhD, so we made the most of it and celebrated the end of an era. It's the only time we've visited a place and felt like we were born in the wrong country.

      { src: "photos/2022_12_new_zealand_13.jpg", caption: "On our last day, we went canyoning. Brian loved it, Alyssa...not so much. It may have had something to do with us getting changed in retrofitted shipping containers, hopping in a van that barely starts, driving up in the middle of cornfields, and then having the guide tell us to crawl through a culvert and then disappear. But we got to rappel down waterfalls and see glow worms." }

We didn't have anything planned so walked around, and ended up finding a \"Path of the Lemons\" trail that took us high up the cliffs between two towns, winding through all the lemon groves." },

      { src: "photos/2023_06_rome_07.jpg", caption: "The Roman Pantheon. In Brian's opinion, one of the most captivating moments of the trip. It's hard to describe the feeling associated with realizing you're standing among 2000+ years of human history." },

      { src: "photos/2023_06_rome_10.jpg", caption: "Brian had a weekend to kill before Alyssa flew in, so rented a manual Fiat Panda with a broken A/C (read, glorified golf cart), and picked a random town in Tuscany. Ended up walking around until he found an old castle on the hill above the town, and then enjoyed a gelato in the town square while listening to an extremely talented street performer. Not a bad way to spend your anniversay weekend apart from your spouse." }

We hiked about 50 miles over 5 days, which was a perfect pace for some absolutely fantastic hiking, while having enough time to stop for breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the mountain rifugios for some top-notch food. Plus sleeping in a real bed (even if surrounded by snoring Italians) is hard to beat.", images: [
      { src: "photos/2024_06_dolomites_01.jpg", caption: "Why hike to the top when you can take a gondola? Make sure you run or you won't catch the car (no joke)." },

      { src: "photos/2024_06_dolomites_05.jpg", caption: "Hike? Or take a scenic gondola ride to the top? A younger Brian would have scoffed at the idea of taking the gondola. But an older, married, Brian thinks the gondola is a great idea. It is vacation, after all." },
      { src: "photos/2024_06_dolomites_06.jpg", caption: "This trip was also a piggy-back off another work trip. Brian got to visit Paris for the first time while visiting a supplier for some high-end space hardware." },
      { src: "photos/2024_06_dolomites_07.jpg", caption: "When we showed up, the weather showed rain and thunderstorms every day. Fortunately this was pessimistic, although we did have to change plans a few times between the rain and the late-season snow." },
      { src: "photos/2024_06_dolomites_08.jpg", caption: "Did Brian wear the same shirt ever day? Maybe. But you don't have many options when living out of a 22L pack for 6 days." },
      { src: "photos/2024_06_dolomites_09.jpg", caption: "Probably some of the best food we've ever had. Add in the fact you're eating it in the middle of majestic mountains. Heaven." },
      { src: "photos/2024_06_dolomites_10.jpg", caption: "Fun fact: the Dolomites cross the border of Tyrol, an independent German-speaking province of Italy that used to be part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire prior to WWI. So we started the hike in a quaint German-esque town, and saying \"danke\" over a plate of dumplings, and ended the hike saying \"grazie\" over pasta. The blend of the two cultures is just one of the things that makes this area so unique." },

Only partly kidding, but we did celebrate her 29th birthday in Disneyland Paris with some of our best friends. We finally convinced Tim and Christa to do a trip with us, and we had an amazing time!

Sitting in a plastic bucket on wheels. Which stopped. Because of the rain. We gave up after that and took the train back to the city for some cheaper, better food and hot chocolate." },
