## June 2022
We celebrated our 4th wedding anniversary in the Poconos.
We stayed in Skytop Lodge, which offered a unique combination of old-style luxury and adventure. We did a high ropes course, kayaking, and mountain biking---we came within 30 feet of a black bear!

## June 2022
Flew out to Arizona for a family reunion with Alyssa's parents, siblings, and nieces and nephews.

*Caption: Brian proud of Alyssa for having the motivation to run a 5k on vacation.*

## July 2022
4th of July on the water in Pittsburgh. It was our first time kayaking out to 
"The Point" where they launch off the fireworks. Paddling back in the dark battling
the chop from all the boats made it extra "Brian fun," less "Alyssa fun."

![alt text](photos/2022_07_1st_time_doing_4th_of_july_fir_01.jpg)
*Caption: Nothing quite beats the view of sitting 200 ft away from where they're launch off the fireworks.*

## August 2022
Weekend family trip to Kinuza Bridge State Park, PA. It's home to what was previously one of the tallest railroad bridges in the world, before it was wiped out by a tornado.

## Oct 2022
"High Peaks of Pain." Brian did a late-season backpacking trip with some good friends, and severely underestimated the Adirondacks, both in beauty and brutality. 
You try boulder-hopping for 12 hours with a backpack and tell me how you feel afterwards.

*Caption: One of rare, but breathtaking, views of real mountains in the East Coast. Mostly you just see trees.*

*Caption: A better-than-average hiking trail in late October. Pretty, but do you see all that mud?!*
![alt text](photos/2022_10_adirondacks_04.JPG)
*Caption: Truth be told, it was an amazing experience, made even better by spending it with great friends; and Jacob's famous back-country cooking.*

## Dec 2022
New Zealand! We spend 2 weeks in New Zealand, road-tripping around both islands. 
It was Brian's last conference trip for his PhD, so we made the most of it and 
celebrated the end of an era. It's the only time we've visited a place and felt like
we were born in the wrong country. To say it left an impression is an understatement.

![alt text](photos/2022_12_new_zealand_05.jpg)
*Caption: After landing in the morning, we got our rental and drove out to Cormandel, where we hiking up to a hostel-style hut in the mountains.*

![alt text](photos/2022_12_new_zealand_04.jpg)
*Caption: Brian attempted to catch the sunrise in Cormandel, but the clouds had other ideas.*

![alt text](photos/2022_12_new_zealand_06.jpg)
*Caption: Hiking in New Zealand is just better. Beautiful views, well-maintained
steel ladders to climb, and excellent bathrooms."

*Caption: Sea kayaking in the Cormandel pensinsula. Another reason NZ is great: the guides brought cookies and made the group fresh tea and coffee on the beach.*

*Caption: Hobbiton! Honestly, the food might have been the best part.*

![alt text](photos/2022_12_new_zealand_11.jpg)
*Caption: Alyssa revels in finally being taller than Brian.*

![alt text](photos/2022_12_new_zealand_03.jpg)
*Caption: Is Brian part Hobbit? Short, yes; just needs to fatten up by eating 6 meals day. Alyssa won't allow it.*

![alt text](photos/2022_12_new_zealand_01.jpg)
*Caption: Ziplining in Rotorua. The blood on Brian's nose is from white-water rafting and sledging the day before.*

*Caption: Rainy day hike in the South Island, near the end of the trip. Alyssa was finally getting over being sick at this point.*

*Caption: Boat tour on a glacial lake. That's the glacier in the background, for the less geologically-inclined.*

*Caption: We still debate this, but this is probably the best view from a hotel room we've had. Mt. Aoraki, NZ.*

![alt text](photos/2022_12_new_zealand_13.jpg)
*Caption: On our last day, we went canyoning. Brian loved it, Alyssa...not so much.
It may have had something to do with us getting changed in retrofitted shipping containers, hopping in a van that barely starts, driving up in the middle of cornfields, and then having the guide tell us to crawl through a culvert and then disappear. But we got to rappel down waterfalls and see glow worms.*

# Feb 2023
We stayed for 3 weeks in Miami, FL. Mostly to escape the dreary
Pittsburgh winter, but also to see Ben, Victoria, and Leilani 
(Brian's first niece on the Jackson side). We got to visit 
Everglades and Biscayne Bay. River managed to not get eaten
by a 'gator.

# Feb 2023
Las Vegas! Our first time doing Vegas, we met up with Tara and Evan (Alyssa's sister and her husband) for an adult sibling 
trip that has now become an annual tradition. 

![alt text](photos/2023_03_las_vegas_01.jpg)
*Caption: We stayed in the Luxor, mostly to save money so Spencer could join us, but he doesn't seem to like the idea of taking vacation anymore. C'mon man, you made us stay in the Luxor!*

# May 2023
A decade of school after high school? Check. Brian insists that
everyone call him "Dr. Jackson" now. (kidding, definitely kidding). For those that don't know, Brian got his PhD in 
Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University. His doctoral research 
was on "Accelerating Numerical Methods for Optimal Control." 
Tldr; nerd.

![alt text](photos/2023_05_graduation_01.jpg)
*Caption: Two software nerds trying to be cool, but really just looking like nerds.*

![alt text](photos/2023_05_graduation_02.jpg)
*Caption: In all seriousness, this was a team effort. Alyssa 
put up with a lot, helping Brian work through a brain injury,
the loss of a father and three grandparents, and a whole lot of
deep restructing in the way he views the world. That was on top
of the endless nerdy discussions with friends about robots, 
optimization, and scientific computing.*

# June 2023
5th Wedding Anniversay: Rome! We piggybacked off of Brian's work
trip to visit Rome and the Almafi Coast.

*Caption: Alyssa in Tuscany.*

![alt text](photos/2023_06_rome_02.jpg)
*Caption: Almafi Coast. Probably our favorite day of the trip. We didn't have anything planned so walked around, and ended up finding a "Path of the Lemons" trail that took us high up the cliffs between two towns, winding through all the lemon groves.*

![alt text](photos/2023_06_rome_03.jpg)
*Caption: Trevi Fountain. Nbd.*

![alt text](photos/2023_06_rome_04.jpg)
*Caption: On this trip we solidified that one of Alyssa's all-time favorite things is a European-style breakfast.*

![alt text](photos/2023_06_rome_05.jpg)
*Caption: Brian and Colosseum. This was actually part of the work trip before Alyssa arrived.*

![alt text](photos/2023_06_rome_06.jpg)
*Caption: Breakfast in Brussels, Belgium.*

![alt text](photos/2023_06_rome_07.jpg)
*Caption: The Roman Pantheon. In Brian's opinion, one of the 
most captivating moments of the trip. It's hard to describe the
feeling associated with realizing you're standing among 2000+ years of human history.*

![alt text](photos/2023_06_rome_08.jpg)
*Caption: More Trevi. Still nbd.*

![alt text](photos/2023_06_rome_09.jpg)
*Caption: The other hotly-debated contestant for "best hotel room view." This was the view from our hotel room on the Almafi Coast.*

![alt text](photos/2023_06_rome_10.jpg)
*Caption: Brian had a weekend to kill before Alyssa flew in, so rented a manual Fiat Panda with a broken A/C (read, glorified golf cart), and picked a random town in Tuscany. Ended up walking around until he found an old castle on the hill above the town, and then enjoyed a gelato in the town square while listening to an extremely talented street performer. Not a bad way to spend your anniversay weekend apart from your spouse.*

# July 2023
4th of July on water again. But this time we brought friends!

*Caption: Chilling on the water.*

*Caption: We somehow convinced Chase and Catrina to join us. Thanks for being our go-to holiday friends!*

# Aug-Dec 2023
House rennovations!

![alt text](photos/2023_08_house_rennovations__backyard_p_01.jpg)
*Caption: We did most of the demo work ourselves, and lived and 
worked in a single room while the contractor worked on the rest of the house. Made our 300 sqrt studio aparment in Stanford feel like luxury.*


![alt text](photos/2023_08_house_rennovations_02.jpg)
*Caption: Unfortunately, the rennovations were pretty hard on 
River. She really missed all the soft places to lay down, so much that she found anything she could and made it work. But she did absolutely love greeting the contractors every morning!

![alt text](photos/2023_08_house_rennovations__backyard_p_02.jpg)
*Caption: While the contractors worked on our house, Brian made progress on our backyard (which was a jungle of weeds and thorns when we bought it in 2020). We got to enjoy hosting a few evening parties with friends while the house was chaos.*

# Oct 2023
Brian biked 335 miles from Washington D.C. to Pittsburgh along the C&O Canal and the Great Allgeheny Passage (which passes by our house).

*Caption: Our timing ended up being great, and we hit some great Fall colors through most of the trail.*

![alt text](photos/2023_10_gap_07.jpg)
*Caption: It was this trip that made Brian want to buy a real gravel bike. Retrofitting his road bike to work for this trip required a bit of creativity.*

![alt text](photos/2023_10_gap_05.jpg)
*Caption: Alyssa and River met us at Point State Park in Pittsburgh to celebrate with us. For you sports fans, that's the Steelers' statium behind us.*

# November 2023
We drove out to Tucson for Thanksgiving, stopping in Denver for a week so Brian could work on spinny space hardware stuff. While
in Tucson, he checked off two goals for this 30s: ride a century, and compete in a bike race. We got to enjoy time with Alyssa's family and the beautiful desert winter weather.

![alt text](photos/2023_11_tour_de_tucson_01.jpg)
*Caption: Fun fact: the Tour de Tucson is one of the largest road bike events in the United States, with about 10,000 riders.*
