# Summary
Dear friends and family. Sorry we haven't sent out an update for 4 years. Turns out a lot has happened since 2021! We've included lots
of photos and juicy details for anyone with time to kill (looking at you Grandma) but will keep it short and sweet here. 

Here's the last 4 years by the numbers:
- Job changes: 4
- New dogs: 1
- Children born: 0
- Countries visited: 6
- Degrees completed: 1
- Marathons run: 1
- National Parks Visited: 6

Alyssa worked for a year at a metaverse startup, but started looking for new opportunities when the paychecks kept getting delayed. She worked for 2 years at Compliancy Group as a Senior Software Engineer, before being recruited by a startup recently acquired by Western Governor's University.
She's still loving her career in software engineering, especially at her current job where she's been able to focus on transitioning to DevOps and Cloud Infrastructure. Outside of work, she's gotten a lot more into running, picked up video editing, and is still crazy about dog training.

Brian graduated with his PhD in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University in 2022, marking the end of an for era us both. After weighing a few different options, he took a leap on a startup called Albedo, a young 20-person startup building low-flying 
satellites to take insanely good satellite images. They launched
their first satellite this year in March 2025. Brian got recruited
by NVIDIA and made the difficult decision to leave Albedo right after their first launch, and has been working on developing software for robotics at NVIDIA since March. Don't worry, he's still a nerd, and will talk your ear off about motion planning for robots and optimization-based control for hours. After convincing Alyssa to get another puppy, Brian has spent a lot of time this year training with their new puppy Tolkien to do search and rescue, and should certify with one of the national associations for working dogs in early 2026.

We still live in Pittsburgh, PA, in the small home we bought when we moved here in 2020. We've grown to love Pittsburgh a lot, in big part thanks to the friends we've made here. We've had a lot of incredible experiences over the last 4 years, but are most grateful for the time we've been able to spend with each other, with our dogs, and with friends and family. With the new year,
we're excited and a little nervous at what's looking to be a year
of adventure, changes, and uncertainty.
We hope 2026 brings you joyful moments, the accomplishment of challenges overcome, and the meaning that comes through investing
yourself in the relationships you value most.

## June 2022
We celebrated our 4th wedding anniversary in the Poconos.
We stayed in Skytop Lodge, which offered a unique combination of old-style luxury and adventure. We did a high ropes course, kayaking, and mountain biking---we came within 30 feet of a black bear!

![anniversary](photos/2022_06_anniversary_01.jpg "Title")
*Caption: Us happy to get away from River for the weekend (kidding, we love that girl and miss her every time we leave)*


## June 2022
Flew out to Arizona for a family reunion with Alyssa's parents, siblings, and nieces and nephews. 

![alt text](photos/2022_06_showlow_01.jpg)
*Caption: In classic Murphy fashion, vacation involved a healthy dose of competitive physical challenges.*

![alt text](photos/2022_06_showlow_02.jpg)
*Caption: Brian proud of Alyssa for having the motivation to run a 5k on vacation.*

## July 2022
4th of July on the water in Pittsburgh. It was our first time kayaking out to 
"The Point" where they launch off the fireworks. Paddling back in the dark battling
the chop from all the boats made it extra "Brian fun," less "Alyssa fun."

![alt text](photos/2022_07_1st_time_doing_4th_of_july_fir_01.jpg)
*Caption: Nothing quite beats the view of sitting 200 ft away from where they're launch off the fireworks.*

## August 2022
Weekend family trip to Kinuza Bridge State Park, PA. It's home to what was previously one of the tallest railroad bridges in the world, before it was wiped out by a tornado.

![alt text](photos/2022_08_kinua_bridge_01.jpg)
*Caption: Oops.*


![alt text](photos/2022_08_kinua_bridge_02.jpg)
*Caption: River's a beautiful dog, and she knows it.*

## Oct 2022
"High Peaks of Pain." Brian did a late-season backpacking trip with some good friends, and severely underestimated the Adirondacks, both in beauty and brutality. 
You try boulder-hopping for 12 hours with a backpack and tell me how you feel afterwards.

![](photos/2022_10_adirondacks_02.jpg)
*Caption: One of rare, but breathtaking, views of real mountains in the East Coast. Mostly you just see trees.*
![alt text](photos/2022_10_adirondacks_04.jpg)
*Caption: Brian faking a smile after doing an obstacle course in the middle of the mountains.*
![alt text](photos/2022_10_adirondacks.jpg)
*Caption: A better-than-average hiking trail in late October. Pretty, but do you see all that mud?!*
![alt text](photos/2022_10_adirondacks_04.JPG)
*Caption: Truth be told, it was an amazing experience, made even better by spending it with great friends; and Jacob's famous back-country cooking.*

## Dec 2022
New Zealand! We spend 2 weeks in New Zealand, road-tripping around both islands. 
It was Brian's last conference trip for his PhD, so we made the most of it and 
celebrated the end of an era. It's the only time we've visited a place and felt like
we were born in the wrong country. To say it left an impression is an understatement.

![alt text](photos/2022_12_new_zealand_05.jpg)
*Caption: After landing in the morning, we got our rental and drove out to Cormandel, where we hiking up to a hostel-style hut in the mountains.*

![alt text](photos/2022_12_new_zealand_04.jpg)
*Caption: Brian attempted to catch the sunrise in Cormandel, but the clouds had other ideas.*

![alt text](photos/2022_12_new_zealand_06.jpg)
*Caption: Hiking in New Zealand is just better. Beautiful views, well-maintained
steel ladders to climb, and excellent bathrooms.* 

![alt text](photos/2022_12_new_zealand_12.jpg)
*Caption: Sunset in Cormandel. Brian trying to be a landscape photographer.*

![alt text](photos/2022_12_new_zealand_10.jpg)
*Caption: Sea kayaking in the Cormandel peninsula. Another reason NZ is great: the guides brought cookies and made the group fresh tea and coffee on the beach.*

![alt text](photos/2022_12_new_zealand_02.jpg)
*Caption: Hobbiton! Honestly, the food might have been the best part.*

![alt text](photos/2022_12_new_zealand_11.jpg)
*Caption: Alyssa revels in finally being taller than Brian.*

![alt text](photos/2022_12_new_zealand_03.jpg)
*Caption: Is Brian part Hobbit? Short, yes; just needs to fatten up by eating 6 meals day. Alyssa won't allow it.*

![alt text](photos/2022_12_new_zealand_01.jpg)
*Caption: Ziplining in Rotorua. The blood on Brian's nose is from white-water rafting and sledging the day before.*

![alt text](photos/2022_12_new_zealand_07.jpg)
*Caption: Rainy day hike in the South Island, near the end of the trip. Alyssa was finally getting over being sick at this point.*

![alt text](photos/2022_12_new_zealand_08.jpg)
*Caption: Boat tour on a glacial lake. That's the glacier in the background, for the less geologically-inclined.*

![alt text](photos/2022_12_new_zealand_09.jpg)
*Caption: We still debate this, but this is probably the best view from a hotel room we've had. Mt. Aoraki, NZ.*

![alt text](photos/2022_12_new_zealand_13.jpg)
*Caption: On our last day, we went canyoning. Brian loved it, Alyssa...not so much.
It may have had something to do with us getting changed in retrofitted shipping containers, hopping in a van that barely starts, driving up in the middle of cornfields, and then having the guide tell us to crawl through a culvert and then disappear. But we got to rappel down waterfalls and see glow worms.*

# Feb 2023
We stayed for 3 weeks in Miami, FL. Mostly to escape the dreary
Pittsburgh winter, but also to see Ben, Victoria, and Leilani 
(Brian's first niece on the Jackson side). We got to visit 
Everglades and Biscayne Bay. River managed to not get eaten
by a 'gator.

![alt text](photos/2023_02_miami_01.jpg)
*Caption: River posing dramatically in the Everglades.*

![alt text](photos/2023_02_miami_03.jpg)
*Caption: River looking for Brian after he left the hotel room to bike to a WeWork for the day.*

![alt text](photos/2023_02_miami_04.jpg)
*Caption: Uncle Brian trying to be a good Uncle, mostly by not dropping the baby in the ocean.*

# Feb 2023
Las Vegas! Our first time doing Vegas, we met up with Tara and Evan (Alyssa's sister and her husband) for an adult sibling 
trip that has now become an annual tradition. 

![alt text](photos/2023_03_las_vegas_01.jpg)
*Caption: We stayed in the Luxor, mostly to save money so Spencer could join us, but he doesn't seem to like the idea of taking vacation anymore. C'mon man, you made us stay in the Luxor!*

![alt text](photos/2023_03_las_vegas_02.jpg)
*Caption: Us vacationing stress-free.*

![alt text](photos/2023_03_las_vegas_03.jpg)
*Caption: Alyssa living her best pink-drink life.*

# May 2023
A decade of school after high school? Check. Brian insists that
everyone call him "Dr. Jackson" now. (kidding, definitely kidding). For those that don't know, Brian got his PhD in 
Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University. His doctoral research 
was on "Accelerating Numerical Methods for Optimal Control." 
Tldr; nerd.

![alt text](photos/2023_05_graduation_01.jpg)
*Caption: Two software nerds trying to be cool, but really just looking like nerds.*

![alt text](photos/2023_05_graduation_02.jpg)
*Caption: In all seriousness, this was a team effort. Alyssa 
put up with a lot, helping Brian work through a brain injury,
the loss of a father and three grandparents, and a whole lot of
deep restructing in the way he views the world. That was on top
of the endless nerdy discussions with friends about robots, 
optimization, and scientific computing.*

# June 2023
5th Wedding Anniversary: Rome! We piggybacked off of Brian's work
trip to visit Rome and the Almafi Coast.


![alt text](photos/2023_06_rome_01.jpg)
*Caption: Alyssa in Tuscany.*

![alt text](photos/2023_06_rome_02.jpg)
*Caption: Almafi Coast. Probably our favorite day of the trip. We didn't have anything planned so walked around, and ended up finding a "Path of the Lemons" trail that took us high up the cliffs between two towns, winding through all the lemon groves.*

![alt text](photos/2023_06_rome_03.jpg)
*Caption: Trevi Fountain. Nbd.*

![alt text](photos/2023_06_rome_04.jpg)
*Caption: On this trip we solidified that one of Alyssa's all-time favorite things is a European-style breakfast.*

![alt text](photos/2023_06_rome_05.jpg)
*Caption: Brian and Colosseum. This was actually part of the work trip before Alyssa arrived.*

![alt text](photos/2023_06_rome_06.jpg)
*Caption: Breakfast in Brussels, Belgium.*

![alt text](photos/2023_06_rome_07.jpg)
*Caption: The Roman Pantheon. In Brian's opinion, one of the 
most captivating moments of the trip. It's hard to describe the
feeling associated with realizing you're standing among 2000+ years of human history.*

![alt text](photos/2023_06_rome_08.jpg)
*Caption: More Trevi. Still nbd.*

![alt text](photos/2023_06_rome_09.jpg)
*Caption: The other hotly-debated contestant for "best hotel room view." This was the view from our hotel room on the Almafi Coast.*

![alt text](photos/2023_06_rome_10.jpg)
*Caption: Brian had a weekend to kill before Alyssa flew in, so rented a manual Fiat Panda with a broken A/C (read, glorified golf cart), and picked a random town in Tuscany. Ended up walking around until he found an old castle on the hill above the town, and then enjoyed a gelato in the town square while listening to an extremely talented street performer. Not a bad way to spend your anniversay weekend apart from your spouse.*

# July 2023
4th of July on water again. But this time we brought friends!

![alt text](photos/2023_07_fourth_01.jpg)
*Caption: Chilling on the water.*

![alt text](photos/2023_07_fourth_02.jpg)
*Caption: We somehow convinced Chase and Catrina to join us. Thanks for being our go-to holiday friends!*

# Aug-Dec 2023
House rennovations!

![alt text](photos/2023_08_house_rennovations__backyard_p_01.jpg)
*Caption: We did most of the demo work ourselves, and lived and 
worked in a single room while the contractor worked on the rest of the house. Made our 300 sqft studio aparment in Stanford feel like luxury.*

![alt text](photos/2023_08_house_rennovations_02.jpg)
*Caption: Unfortunately, the rennovations were pretty hard on 
River. She really missed all the soft places to lay down, so much that she found anything she could and made it work. But she did absolutely love greeting the contractors every morning!

![alt text](photos/2023_08_house_rennovations__backyard_p_02.jpg)
*Caption: While the contractors worked on our house, Brian made progress on our backyard (which was a jungle of weeds and thorns when we bought it in 2020). We got to enjoy hosting a few evening parties with friends while the house was chaos.*

# Oct 2023
Brian biked 335 miles from Washington D.C. to Pittsburgh along the C&O Canal and the Great Allegheny Passage (which passes by our house).

![alt text](photos/2023_10_gap_03.jpg)
*Caption: Mile 0 marker in D.C.*

![alt text](photos/2023_10_gap_01.jpg)
*Caption: Rolling Pennsylvania countryside.*

![alt text](photos/2023_10_gap_04.jpg)
*Caption: Our timing ended up being great, and we hit some great Fall colors through most of the trail.*

![alt text](photos/2023_10_gap_07.jpg)
*Caption: It was this trip that made Brian want to buy a real gravel bike. Retrofitting his road bike to work for this trip required a bit of creativity.*

![alt text](photos/2023_10_gap_05.jpg)
*Caption: Alyssa and River met us at Point State Park in Pittsburgh to celebrate with us. For you sports fans, that's the Steelers' stadium behind us.*

# November 2023
We drove out to Tucson for Thanksgiving, stopping in Denver for a week so Brian could work on spinny space hardware stuff. While
in Tucson, he checked off two goals for this 30s: ride a century, and compete in a bike race. We got to enjoy time with Alyssa's family and the beautiful desert winter weather.

![alt text](photos/2023_11_tour_de_tucson_01.jpg)
*Caption: Fun fact: the Tour de Tucson is one of the largest road bike events in the United States, with about 10,000 riders.*

# February 2024
Las Vegas again! This time we upgraded in the Cosmo. Again had a great time with Tara and Evan!

![alt text](photos/2024_02_las_vegas_01.jpg)
*Caption: Sharks in the desert. Of course.*

![alt text](photos/2024_02_las_vegas_02.jpg)
*Caption: Despite having very low expectations the first time, Brian has reluctantly agreed that Vegas is actually kinda fun.*

# May 2024
Alyssa completed her first marathon!

![alt text](photos/2024_05_marathon_01.jpg)
*Caption: It didn't turn out as well as she hoped, but she pushed through and finished it! Turns out hyponatremia is a thing.*

# June 2024
Our favorite vacation to-date: the Dolomites. We hiked about 50 miles over 5 days, which was a perfect pace for some absolutely fantastic hiking, while having enough time to stop for breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the mountain rifugios for some top-notch food. Plus sleeping in a real bed (even if surrounded by snoring Italians) is hard to beat.

![alt text](photos/2024_06_dolomites_01.jpg)
*Caption: Why hike to the top when you can take a gondola? Make sure you run or you won't catch the car (no joke).*

![alt text](photos/2024_06_dolomites_02.jpg)
*Caption: Just one of so many breath-taking views.*

![alt text](photos/2024_06_dolomites_03.jpg)
*Caption: Hard to beat the feeling of drinking a fantastic espresso in the middle of the mountains.*

![alt text](photos/2024_06_dolomites_04.jpg)
*Caption: Our first true rifugio we stayed in. We ended up chatting the evening away with some middle-aged German dads. They may or may not have convinced Brian to take shots of fermented flower root...*

![alt text](photos/2024_06_dolomites_05.jpg)
*Caption: Hike? Or take a scenic gondola ride to the top? A younger Brian would have scoffed at the idea of taking the gondola. 
But an older, married, Brian thinks
the gondola is a great idea. It is vacation, after all.*

![alt text](photos/2024_06_dolomites_06.jpg)
*Caption: This trip was also a piggy-back off another work trip. Brian
got to visit Paris for the first time while visiting a supplier for some
high-end space hardware.*

![alt text](photos/2024_06_dolomites_07.jpg)
*Caption: When we showed up, the weather showed rain and thunderstorms
every day. Fortunately this was pessimistic, although we did have to 
change plans a few times between the rain and the late-season snow.*

![alt text](photos/2024_06_dolomites_08.jpg)
*Caption: Did Brian wear the same shirt ever day? Maybe. But you don't have many options when living out of a 22L pack for 6 days.*

![alt text](photos/2024_06_dolomites_09.jpg)
*Caption: Probably some of the best food we've ever had. Add in the fact you're eating it in the middle of majestic mountains. Heaven.*

![alt text](photos/2024_06_dolomites_10.jpg)
*Caption: Fun fact: the Dolomites cross the border of Tyrol, an independent German-speaking province of Italy that used to be part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire prior to WWI. So we started the hike in a quaint German-esque town, and saying "danke" over a plate of dumplings, and ended the hike saying "grazie" over pasta. The blend of the two cultures is just one of the things that makes this area so unique.*

![alt text](photos/2024_07_venice_01.jpg)
*Caption: We ended our trip in Venice. Which was cool, but underwhelming after what were seriously some of the best vacation days we've ever had.*

# October 2024
For Alyssa's birthday, she really wanted to do Disneyland, Paris. So she got her wish. Only partly kidding, but we did celebrate her 29th 
birthday in Disneyland Paris with some of our best friends. We finally
convinced Tim and Christa to do a trip with us, and we had an amazing 
time! And meeting up with Chase and Catrina for a few days made it even
better. We're so grateful for amazing friends who put up with us.

![alt text](photos/2024_10_paris_01.jpg)
*Caption: *

![alt text](photos/2024_10_paris_02.jpg)
*Caption: Highlight of our Disneyland Paris experience: having done pretty much all the rides since it was a slow, dreary day, we ended up on Autopia (you know, the one where you sit in a tiny car and go around a track), only to be surprised by a torrential downpour. Sitting in a plastic bucket on wheels. Which stopped. Because of the rain. We gave
up after that and took the train back to the city for some cheaper, better food and hot chocolate.*

![alt text](photos/2024_10_paris_03.jpg)
*Caption: We spent a few days in the Loire Valley with Tim and Christa,
visiting fancy chateaus and eating fancy food.*

![alt text](photos/2024_10_paris_04.jpg)
*Caption: We also had the great fortune of meeting up with Andrew and Jamie. Andrew and I were both on the software team at Albedo, and this trip was a much-needed break from the gruelling hours getting the satellite ready for launch.*

![alt text](photos/2024_10_paris_05.jpg)
*Caption: The obligatory couple photo in front of the Eiffel Tower.*

# November 2024
New puppy!! Meet Tolkien the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever. 
We've wanted a Toller for years, and after Brian promised to be the
dog-dad to our new puppy, we finally decided to give River a sibling.

![alt text](photos/2024_11_tolkien_01.jpg)
*Caption: Don't let the cutness fool you: he screamed most of the car ride home.*

![alt text](photos/2024_11_tolkien_02.jpg)
*Caption: Brian and his fluff ball.*

![alt text](photos/2024_11_tolkien_03.jpg)
*Caption: While socializing him, we were stopped more than once in a store by someone saying "oh my goodness, I thought that was a stuffed animal!" Because yes, a grown man is more likely to walk around stores carrying a stuffed animal puppy than a real puppy.*

![alt text](photos/2024_11_tolkien_04.jpg)
*Caption: Tolkien loves sleeping on pillows. Only slightly spoiled.* 

# March 2025
In March, Brian left Albedo to join NVIDIA, but negotiated to stay with
Albedo through the launch of their first satellite, shown on top of 
SpaceX's Transporter 13 below. Alyssa is grateful to NVIDIA for giving
her husband back to her.

![alt text](photos/2025_03_launch.jpg)

# May 2025
We flew down to Miami to celebrate Ben's (Brian's brother) graduation from dental school.


![alt text](photos/2025_05_ben_graduation_02.JPG)
*Caption: Now we have two "Dr. Jackson's" in the family.*

![alt text](photos/2025_05_ben_graduation_01.JPG)
*Caption: We splurged a bit and got an ocean-front hotel room while we
were there. Had to live up to the dinkwad steriotype, of course.*

# June 2025
After a couple of fancy international wedding anniversaries, we took it chill this year and spent a long weekend camping with our dogs in Shannendoah National Park.

![alt text](photos/2025_06_shannendoah_01.JPG)
*Caption: Tolkien's first camping trip.*

![alt text](photos/2025_06_shannendoah_02.JPG)

we got at the end of our trip.*

*Caption: After a long warming-up period, River has accepted Tolkien and frequently shows her love by pinning him to the ground by his neck.*

# August 2025
After an embarassingly long time of living on the East Coast without 
visiting the Big Apple, we finally made it to New York City! We skipped
Vegas the year and did an East Coast vacation with Tara and Evan to mix
it up. 


![alt text](photos/2025_08_ny_01.JPG)
*Caption: We're weird. It's fine.*

![alt text](photos/2025_08_ny_02.JPG)
*Caption: Again, not claiming to be normal people.*

![alt text](photos/2025_08_ny_03.JPG)
*Caption: A failed attempt at being semi-normal.*

# August 2025
Brian took a trip with Craig, one of his best friends from Stanford,
out to Olympic National Park. Lots of great views, fantastic conversation, and peak bagging.

![alt text](photos/2025_08_olympic_01.JPG)
*Caption: While the sleep is always sub-par, the sites while backpacking are always the best.*

![alt text](photos/2025_08_olympic_02.JPG)
*Caption: We camped next to a mountain lake, which we had entirely to 
ourselves.*

![alt text](photos/2025_08_olympic_03.JPG)
*Caption: A huge thanks to Craig for making this trip happen.*

![alt text](photos/2025_08_olympic_04.JPG)
*Caption: Brian was very happy to scratch the ol' peak-bagging itch, 
which is much harder to scratch living on the East Coast.*

# September 2025
One of Brian's primary focuses for 2025 was training with Tolkien to do
search and rescue (finding lost people in the woods). They're almost 
certified (it usually takes about 1.5-2 years), and Tolkien absolutely
loves it, and is a natural at it. We went as a family to 3-day seminar
where our dog-training nerdiness was on full display. Alyssa says this 
was her favorite weekend of the year.

![alt text](photos/2025_09_sar_seminar_01.jpg)
*Caption: A rare action shot of Tolkien working with Brian. Tolkien is
absolutely obsessed with fetch and works for hours just to play for a few minutes at the end of a search.*


# October 2025
As a final wrap on 2025, we planned a last-minute trip to Barcelona for a long weekend. 

![alt text](photos/2025_11_barcelona_01.jpg)
